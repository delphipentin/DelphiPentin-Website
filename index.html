        <div class="subheading mb-5">Pre-BusinessðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Delphi Pentin is a driven and creative student currently pursuing a degree in Pre-Business at the University of California, Riverside. In her free time, she enjoys a variety of hobbies, including hiking, playing tennis, and creating art. Hiking allows her to explore the natural beauty of Southern California, while tennis provides a fun and competitive outlet for her energy. She finds that being in nature helps her clear her mind and recharge, which in turn helps her stay focused and productive in my studies and other areas of my life. When she's not outdoors, she can be found working on art projects, ranging from painting and drawing to sculpture and mixed media.

Delphi's passion for art has been a constant throughout her life, and she has been creating and experimenting with different mediums since she was a child. She believes that art is a powerful means of expression, and she is always looking for new ways to challenge herself and develop her skills. She has even incorporated her love of art into her academic pursuits, taking classes in acting and dance to deepen her understanding of different styles of art.
<br><br>

        Delphi is a highly motivated student at the University of California, Riverside, pursuing a degree in Pre-Business with a potential future focus on marketing. However, she has not limited herself to only studying business-related subjects. She has taken multiple courses in science, math, and English to broaden her knowledge and expand her skill set.

Her academic pursuits have not been limited to the classroom either. She has participated in various extracurricular activities, including volunteering at local nonprofits, serving as a peer mentor to other students, and participating in the UCR Marketing Club. These experiences have allowed her to develop a wide range of skills, from leadership and teamwork to project management and event planning.
<br><br>

        In addition to her academic and extracurricular activities, Delphi Pentin has also gained professional experience through internships and other life-experience learning opportunities. She has interned at a local cheer gym, where she helped develop safe and fun training classes and assisted with client outreach. She also worked as a part time nanny, helping supervise and teach children of many ages. Although these experiences seem unimportant, they actually taught Delphi a variety of skills such as communication, time management, patience, problem solving, and responsibility.

Through her various academic, extracurricular, and professional experiences, Delphi has demonstrated her ability to work collaboratively, communicate effectively, and think critically. She has a passion for learning and is always seeking out new challenges and opportunities to grow. Her dedication and work ethic make her an asset to any team, and she is sure to excel in her future endeavors. While her professional experience is currently somewhat limited to her academic pursuits and focusing on school, she is committed to pursuing opportunities to gain hands-on experience and build her network within the business community. She is a dedicated and hardworking individual, and she believes that she can do anything she sets her mind to because she is willing to work hard, persevere through challenges, and take on new challenges in order to achieve her objectives.
